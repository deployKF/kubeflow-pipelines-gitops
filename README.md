# GitOps for Kubeflow Pipelines

This repo demonstrates how GitOps can be used with [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/tools/#kubeflow-pipelines) from [deployKF](https://github.com/deployKF/deployKF).

In this case, we will use GitOps for managing pipelines and their schedules, not for the platform itself, which deployKF already supports.
